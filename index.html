                <h3 id="headline">His life and work</h3>
                <p>Isaac Asimov's contributions to the science fiction genre come through his novels and short stories. He believed that the "Three Laws of Robotics", a set of rules he devised that form an organizing principle for all of his robotic-based-fiction, would become his more enduring work alongside the "Foundation" series.
